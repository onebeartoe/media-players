/*
    The class SimpleAnimationApplet provides a generic framework for applets
    that do simple animations.  This framework is appropriate for an animation
    that runs continuously as long as the applet is active.  It is assumed that
    each time a new frame of the animation is to be drawn, that frame will be
    drawn completely from scratch.
    
    To use this framework, define a subclass of SimpleAnimationApplet and
    override the drawFrame method.  This method is responsible for drawing
    one frame of the animation.  If you want to customize the animation, with
    calls to setFrameCount() and setMillisecondsPerFrame() for example, you
    can define a "public void init()" method in your applet.  Use the init()
    method to call the customization routines as well as to do any initialization
    required for your animation.  Note that you should not override the standard
    applet routines start(), stop(), ane destroy(), without calling the versions
    defined below in the SimpleAnimationApplet class.
    
    (Alternatively, instead of defining a subclass, you could copy this
    file, change its name, and edit it.)
